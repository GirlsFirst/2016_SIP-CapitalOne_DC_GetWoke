<p>Poverty, which is defined as the state of being extremely poor, has remained a major problem in the world for centuries.  While many nations have progressed due to advancements in technology, there are still some countries who continue to live in an orthodox state.  Many of the countries do not have enough money for technological and social development/advancement. The only way to fix this problem is to lend a hand and aid such countries with ideas, financial aid, and technology.</p>
